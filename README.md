### Hello there :bearded_person:

I'm a data scientist from SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil, currently working at @4intelligence as a Senior Data Scientist and Team Leader for the company's autoML application, developing all stages, from research and development of machine learning algorithms to cloud architecture design and implementation, backend development and stakeholder communication.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with:
  -  Machine Learning R&D
  -  Leading teams for solving ML/data related problems
  -  Time series forecasting
  -  Implementing SOTA models *paper to production*
  -  Designing and implementing cloud applications with Kubernetes
  -  Developing new ML models and pipelines
  -  Model optimization
  -  Data pipelines
  -  ML applications on Kubernetes with native k8s, Argo Workflows and Katib
  -  Writing  and refactoring code to be production ready in both Python:snake: and R to run on Google Cloud Platform
  -  Training and optimizing deep learning models on Microsoft Azure and AWS

  
- :art: Some personal projects include:
  - Image classification tasks ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/CarModelClassifier) | [Deployed Model](https://car-classiflier.herokuapp.com/))
  - Customer Segmentation and Prediction - 15Âº place at the respective Kaggle competition ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/Customer-Acquisition-Arvato-Bertelsmann) | [Report](https://github.com/zaterka/Customer-Acquisition-Arvato-Bertelsmann/raw/main/Udacity-Capstone_Project-PedroZaterka.pdf))
  - :construction: Comprehensive implementation of the Grokking Deep Learning book by Andrew Trask ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/ML-studies-and-examples/blob/main/Studies_Deep_Learning_from_scratch_Grokking_Deep_Learning.ipynb))
  - Deploying a PyTorch model in AWS using SageMaker ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/MachineLearningEngineerNanoDegree/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Deploying%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20PyTorch%20in%20AWS))


Feel free to message me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrozaterka/)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Master of Science in Structural Engineering, having my research based around modelling wind loads using Computational Fluid Dynamics, so I guess I can answer regarding best practices using Finite Elements Analysis and Finite Volumes as well.
