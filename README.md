### Hello there :bearded_person:

I'm a data scientist from SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil, currently working at @4intelligence in the AutoML & Timeseries team as a Research Data Scientist and ML Engineer, although sometimes I partake on Backend development tasks :nerd_face:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with:
  -  Time series forecasting
  -  Leading teams for solving ML/data related problems
  -  Implementing SOTA models *paper to production*
  -  Developing new ML models and pipelines
  -  Model optimization
  -  Data pipelines
  -  ML applications on Kubernetes with Argo Workflows
  -  Writing  and refactoring code to be production ready in both Python:snake: and R to run on Google Cloud Platform
  - Training and optimizing deep learning models on Microsoft Azure and AWS

  
- :art: Some personal projects include:
  - Image classification tasks ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/CarModelClassifier) | [Deployed Model](https://car-classiflier.herokuapp.com/))
  - Customer Segmentation and Prediction - 15Âº place at the respective Kaggle competition ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/Customer-Acquisition-Arvato-Bertelsmann) | [Report](https://github.com/zaterka/Customer-Acquisition-Arvato-Bertelsmann/raw/main/Udacity-Capstone_Project-PedroZaterka.pdf))
  - :construction: Comprehensive implementation of the Grokking Deep Learning book by Andrew Trask ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/ML-studies-and-examples/blob/main/Studies_Deep_Learning_from_scratch_Grokking_Deep_Learning.ipynb))
  - Deploying a PyTorch model in AWS using SageMaker ([Repo](https://github.com/zaterka/MachineLearningEngineerNanoDegree/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Deploying%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20PyTorch%20in%20AWS))


Feel free to message me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedrozaterka/)

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Master of Science in Structural Engineering, having my research based around modelling wind loads using Computational Fluid Dynamics, so I guess I can answer regarding best practices using Finite Elements Analysis and Finite Volumes as well.
